## 📊 E-commerce Sales Dashboard (Excel)
This project presents an interactive and visually compelling Sales Dashboard developed entirely in Microsoft Excel. Tailored for e-commerce businesses, it enables users to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), uncover insights from sales data, and make informed decisions based on regional trends, product performance, and time-based analysis.

### 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this dashboard is to provide stakeholders with an at-a-glance view of their business’s sales performance without requiring advanced tools like Power BI or Tableau. It leverages Excel’s powerful capabilities—Pivot Tables, slicers, formulas, and charting tools—to transform raw sales data into actionable insights.

### 🧩 Features & Functionalities
Region-Wise Sales Performance
Analyze total sales and profits across various regions using bar charts and map visualizations, helping identify high-performing markets and areas that need attention.

Monthly Trend Analysis
Visualize trends in revenue and profits month-over-month to support strategic planning, forecasting, and campaign evaluation.

Product Category & Profitability Insights
Filter sales and profit data by product category using slicers, allowing users to quickly assess which categories are driving the most value.

Order Age Distribution
A histogram displays the distribution of order processing times, offering operational insight into delays or fulfillment efficiency.

Dynamic KPIs Panel
Automatically updated KPIs—including Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Order Value, and Number of Orders—provide real-time feedback as filters change.

Interactive Filtering with Slicers
Excel slicers enable intuitive filtering by Region, Month, and Product Category. The entire dashboard responds to these changes seamlessly, allowing custom views for different stakeholders.

### ⚙️ Technical Approach
Built using Excel’s Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts for modular and responsive analytics.

Implemented dynamic named ranges and Excel formulas (e.g., SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIF) to automate data aggregation and calculations.

Linked KPI metrics to visual elements for a synchronized analytical experience.

Used data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure reliable results and fast refresh times.

Applied conditional formatting and minimalist chart designs to enhance readability and aesthetic clarity.
